Package for Angular app, with all essential components for ratings, like stars and inputs.

## Developer Quick Start

after cloning repo, first install all needed dependencies :

this is needed to apply new changes to dev envirement :

    npm run build-libw

after that is finished in NEW terminal serve dev envirement for testing

    npm run start

now you are redy to go :)

## Code scaffolding

Run `npm run clib -- --name=${YOUR_NAME_HERE}` to generate a new component. 

## Build

Run `npm run build-lib` to build library code. 

## Running unit tests and Liting

Run `npm run lint-lib` to lint library code, and check for potential errors. 

Run `npm run test-lib` to run all library tests. 

Please do this step before you start working and after you done, becuse this is needed to pass in orders to merge new changes in project.
